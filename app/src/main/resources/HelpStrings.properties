account_description=Allows you to manage your connection with your Geometry Dash account.
account_link_body=Shows your account linking status. Linking your account allows UltimateGDBot to establish a mapping \
  between Geometry Dash users and Discord users, which can unlock a lot of possibilities. For example you can use \
  some commands by tagging directly a Discord user instead of typing his GD username, build a server-wide Geometry \
  Dash leaderboard (see leaderboard command), and more. Use the `link` subcommand to start linking your account, then\
  \ you need to follow instructions given by the command to complete the linking process. When you have followed all \
  instructions, type `done` in chat. To unlink your account, use the subcommand `unlink`. Note that you can link \
  several Discord accounts to the same GD account, but you can\'\'t link several GD accounts to the same Discord \
  account. This is designed so if you lose access to your Discord account, you can still use a new Discord account to\
  \ link.

  status as if you pressed the \'\'REQ\'\' button in-game, but note that it doesn\'\'t actually push this button for \
  you. It just checks for the presence of the \'\'M\'\' badge on the profile, nothing else.

leaderboard_ban_body=Players that are banned from leaderboards won\'\'t be displayed in the results of the \

  that have a Geometry Dash account linked may be shown in the leaderboards provided by this command.\n`stat_name` \

  to ensure the authenticity of the information and to avoid duplicate announcements.
