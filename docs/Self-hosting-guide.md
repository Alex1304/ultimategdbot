# Self-hosting guide

UltimateGDBot offers native support for self-hosting, meaning that you can run your own instance of UltimateGDBot, useful if you wish to use UltimateGDBot for a Geometry Dash private server (GDPS). This guide will show you how to host the bot yourself.

## Prepare the project

The first step is to get a copy of UltimateGDBot and build the application with the desired parameters. Folllow the steps below thoroughly.

### Prerequisites

Here are the minimum requirements to build and run your own version of UltimateGDBot:

#### Hardware

- 1 GB of RAM
- 2 CPU cores (1 is okay but might be slow)

#### Software

- Java Runtime Environment 8 or above
- Apache Maven
- MySQL or MariaDB with root privileges
- Git

I let you search on Google for installation tutorials of these pieces of software for your OS.

### Clone the project from GitHub

Run the following in a terminal

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Alex1304/ultimategdbot.git
cd ultimategdbot
```

### Prepare the database

In the newly created directory you have a file called `database.sql`. Run this SQL script in your MySQL/MariaDB database in order to create the necessary tables. 

After that, you need to fill out the global settings for the bot. For now there is only one, `channel_debug_logs`, which allows you to choose a Discord channel where the bot can send debug messages. Create a new entry in the `global_settings` table in the database, assign to the row the ID 1, and put the ID of the desired channel in the `channel_debug_logs` column. This would correspond to the following SQL command:

```sql
INSERT INTO global_settings VALUES (1, XXXXX);
```

with XXXXX being the ID of the desired debug log channel.

This step is very important. If you don't do this, the bot won't work.

### Create a bot account

You need to create a bot account on Discord to run the bot. This can be done by going to [https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), creating a new app and creating the bot account in the Bot tab.

### Build the bot application

This is the most delicate step. Indeed, all required information for the bot to run (database credentials, bot token, etc) must be given during the build phase of the app. The command to build the app without parameter is `mvn package`. To give parameters to the build command, the syntax is `-Dparam="value"` and they should be placed before the `package` keyword. Example:

```sh
mvn -Dfirstparam="somevalue" -Dsecondparam="someothervalue" -Dotherparam="anothervalue" package
```

Here are the parameters you effectively need to give to the command:

- `ultimategdbot.release.channel` - The build environment of the bot (whether it's a beta version or a stable version). This affects the behavior of the `about` command, in the first line where the version number and build type is displayed. Note that to change the version number, you need to do it by editing the `pom.xml` file and change the value inside the first occurence of the `<version>` tag.
- `ultimategdbot.prefix.full` - You define the bot's long prefix here. The official bot uses `ugdb!` as long prefix, you are free to change it here.
- `ultimategdbot.prefix.canonical` - You define the bot's short prefix here. The official bot uses `u!` as short prefix, you are free to change it here as well.
- `hibernate.hikari.dataSource.url` - The URL of your MySQL database. The URL is in the following format: `jdbc:mysql://%HOSTNAME%:%PORT%/%DATABASE_NAME%`, where %HOSTNAME% is the hostname or IP address of the database, %PORT% is the connection port of the database (you can omit it if you're using the default one, remember to remove the colon after the hostname if you do so), and %DATABASE_NAME% is the name of the database created by the script you ran previously.
- `hibernate.hikari.dataSource.user` - The username to login to database
- `hibernate.hikari.dataSource.password` - The password to login to database
- `ultimategdbot.client.id` - The Discord client ID of the bot. You can find it in the Discord's developer website where you created the bot account.
- `ultimategdbot.client.token` - The Discord authentication token of the bot. As well as for the client ID, you can find it in the application page of the Discord developer website. You need to go to the Bot tab and reveal the token. Copy and paste it as the value of this parameter
- `ultimategdbot.hierarchy.owner_id` - The ID of the bot owner's Discord account. The user specified here will have access to administration commands of the bot. To get the ID of a Discord account, enable Developer mode in your Discord settings, right click any user and click Copy ID.
- `ultimategdbot.hierarchy.official_guild_id` - The ID of the official Discord server for your instance of the bot. To get the ID, same process as before, right click any server and select Copy ID.
- `ultimategdbot.hierarchy.moderator_role_id` - The ID of the Moderator role in the official server. It is important that the role is part of the official guild provided above. To get a role ID, it's a bit more tricky. To do that, make the role mentionnable and send a mention of the role with a backslash before the @ symbol. Example: `\@moderators`. The numbers wrapped into `<@& >` is the role ID. People with this role will have access to moderation commands on the bot.
- `ultimategdbot.gd_client.id` - The ID of the bot's Geometry Dash account. This is the Geometry Dash account that users need to send a message to in order to link their accounts. Create a new account on Geometry Dash and put the account ID here. If it's from the official Geometry Dash servers, you can use the `profile` command of the official UltimateGDBot to get the account ID. If it's from a GDPS, contact the GDPS owner to get the account ID.
- `ultimategdbot.gd_client.password` - The password of the GD account given previously
- `ultimategdbot.misc.emoji_guild_id.%LABEL%` - The ID of the Discord server where custom emojis are stored. UltimateGDBot uses custom emojis for Coins, Downloads, Likes, Demon icons, Difficulty icons, etc. Download the custom emojis pack [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nhDUgMjdjui_AxtGqZy65t7HLILyscQD), unzip the file and upload the emojis to Discord. Since there are more than 50 emojis in total, you need to dispatch them in several servers. You must provide each server with a different label by replacing %LABEL% with an alphanumeric identifier, ex `ultimategdbot.misc.emoji_guild_id.1` and `ultimategdbot.misc.emoji_guild_id.2`.

All of the parameters above are *required*. There is one parameter that is optional, it's called `ultimategdbot.gd_client.url`. This parameter allows you to specify the URL of a GDPS. The URL must start with `http://` and **must not have a slash at the end**. The default value is `http://www.boomlings.com/database`, the official Geometry Dash server's URL.

In the end, the build command should look like this (values given here are just examples of course):

```sh
mvn -Dultimategdbot.release.channel="stable" -Dultimategdbot.prefix.full="ugdb!" -Dultimategdbot.prefix.canonical="u!" -Dhibernate.hikari.dataSource.url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/ultimategdbot" -Dhibernate.hikari.dataSource.user="CoolUsername" -Dhibernate.hikari.dataSource.password="MyP@ssword" -Dultimategdbot.client.id="123456789" -Dultimategdbot.client.token="TheTokenHerejxbkhfnkhsbfhsbckhsllhjjjgcSKFQCQCqcGeGSEcEqyVBFj" -Dultimategdbot.hierarchy.owner_id="987456321" -Dultimategdbot.hierarchy.official_guild_id="85274196" -Dultimategdbot.hierarchy.moderator_role_id="786512570000" -Dultimategdbot.gd_client.id="8888888" -Dultimategdbot.gd_client.password="An0thâ‚¬rP@ssw0rd" -Dultimategdbot.misc.emoji_guild_id.1="9999999999" -Dultimategdbot.misc.emoji_guild_id.2="66666666666" package
```

If it says BUILD SUCCESS, a JAR file has been created in a directory called `target/`, this is the JAR file you will need to run to start the bot. If you ever need to change one of the parameters, you need to re-run the build command with the correct parameters and grab the new JAR file.

If it says BUILD FAILURE or if the JAR file refuses to start, try to solve the problem by yourself by looking at the errors displayed in console, and if you are stuck don't hesitate to reach support by following instructions in the Home page of this manual.

## Administration commands

As the bot owner or bot moderator, you have access to extra commands that are not listed in the regular commands list.

### `modules`

Owner only. This is where you start and stop modules of the bot. The bot implementation is modular, each module encapsulates a particular functionality. Currently the modules are:

- `commands` - This module registers all command and exposes them to everyone. If this module is disabled, nobody will be able to use any command, except for the bot owner (so the module can be started again later).
- `reply` - This module handles interactive menus and navigation menus. If this module is disabled, you can no longer navigate through level search results or leaderboards, and commands containing subcommands won't work anymore unless the subcommands are given as arguments. Generally it is deprecated to disable this module, as it can negatively affect users experience. If you have issues with some commands, it's better to disable the whole `commands` module instead.
- `gd_events` - This module encapsulates the scanners for GD events. A scanner is a task that refreshes the Awarded page, the Daily level and the Weekly demon at a periodic rate in order to see if there are changes. This way the bot can detect that a level got rated/Daily/Weekly and automatically notify the configured channels in real time. If this module is disabled, the bot will stop scanning for changes in GD and it's up to the owner to trigger awarded/daily/weekly events using `pushevent`.
- `guild_events` - Just a small module that sends messages in the debug log channel everytime people add or remove the bot from their Discord server. It's useful to keep track of the servers the bot joins or leaves.

To start a module, use the `start` subcommand followed by the name of the module. Example:

```
[prefix]modules start gd_events
```

To stop a module, use the `stop` subcommand followed by the name of the module. Example:

```
[prefix]modules stop commands
```

When a module starts or stops, a message is sent in the debug log channel. When the bot starts, all modules are enabled by default. So if you disable a module and then restart the bot (for example using the `restart` command), this module will be re-enabled.

### `pushevent`

Owner only. Allows you to manually trigger a Geometry Dash event.

```
[prefix]pushevent 1 12345678
```

will trigger a new rated level notification for level with ID 12345678. Note that only level IDs are supported here, you cannot give a level name. See the instructions on the pushevent command message to know the other events you can push.

### `restart`

Owner and moderators. Allows you to restart the whole bot. It terminates the JVM and starts the JAR file as a separate process.

## `shutdown`

Owner only. Shuts down the bot completely. The JVM is terminated and the bot will go offline.

## `system`

Owners and moderators. Allows you to monitor the system resources that the bot is consuming. It gives info on both memory usage and CPU load.
