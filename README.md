# UltimateGDBot

UltimateGDBot is originally a Discord bot designed for Geometry Dash players. This project has then been made sufficiently generic to be used for any purpose, thanks to its Plugin API.
Please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/Alex1304/ultimategdbot-gd-plugin) for the plugin that provides Geometry Dash commands.

If you are planning to self-host the bot, a tutorial will be available soon in the wiki pages of this repo.
